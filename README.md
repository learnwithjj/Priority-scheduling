# Priority-scheduling
Priority scheduling is a scheduling process based on priority.
We consider all the arrival time to be 0.
We sort the priorities based on the processors.
Consider 4 processors.
 priority={2,1,4,3}
 burst time={10,4,5,3}

| p2  | p1  | p4  | p3  |
0     4     14    17    22

Turn around time=completion time - arrival time
Waiting time= turn around time - burst time
